Instafilter is a jQuery plugin that provides as-you-type filtering of a list of items.

Usage:
{{{
	$('#search').liveUpdate({
          listSelector:     '#items',
          itemSelector:     'li',
          contentSelector:  '.text'}).focus();
}}}

`#search`: This selector indicates the text field into which the user is typing.
`listSelector`: An outer element to search within. By changing this, you can have several instafilters running on the same page.
`itemSelector`: The bounding element of an individual list item (not necessarily an `li` element).
`contentSelector`: The boundary of the searchable text within each item.
