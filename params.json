{"name":"Instafilter","tagline":"Live filtering jQuery plugin with fuzzy matching","body":"**Instafilter** is a jQuery plugin that uses fuzzy matching to filter a list of items as you type.\r\n\r\nIt allows you to restrict the searchable text of each item, so that HTML tags, URLs, etc. don't cause false positives.\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n```javascript\r\n\t$('#search').liveUpdate({\r\n          listSelector:     '#items',\r\n          itemSelector:     'li',\r\n          contentSelector:  '.text'});\r\n```\r\n\r\n`#search`: This selector should match the search box, a single text field element.\r\n\r\n`listSelector`: An outer element to search within. By changing this, you can have several lists being searched on the same page.\r\n\r\n`itemSelector`: The bounding element of an individual list item (not necessarily an `li` element).\r\n\r\n`contentSelector`: The boundary of the searchable text within each item. Text not within this selector is not searched.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdapted from:\r\n\r\nhttp://ejohn.org/blog/jquery-livesearch/#postcomment\r\n\r\nhttp://orderedlist.com/blog/articles/live-search-with-quicksilver-style-for-jquery/\r\n\r\nSee Also:\r\nhttps://github.com/riklomas/quicksearch\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
